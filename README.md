# Game_of_Ur

This is my attempt at recreating the Royal Game of Ur, and to learn networking in the process


**The Royal Game of Ur, also known as the Game of Twenty Squares or simply the Game of Ur, 
is a two-player strategy race board game that was first played in ancient Mesopotamia during the early third millennium BC**
